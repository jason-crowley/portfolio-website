## About Me

> I love to learn.

I am never satified with just scratching the surface of a subject. When I tackle
  learning something new, I try to dive deep and understand each fundamental
  concept separately before I try to understand it as a whole.

> I'm a team player.

I pull my own weight, and I'm conscious about making code clean, tested, and
  well-documented for others. I get along well with my peers, and I'm
  understanding to other people's needs.

> I'm not one to quit.

I'm motivated and like to see things through to the end. I'm constantly pushing
  myself to improve my skills and efficiency as a developer.
